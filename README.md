# Scalable Tooltips

### Original mod made by dulkir, adjusted to only have scalable tooltips leftover.

Do not contact dulkir for issues this mod causes. Open a github issues ticket or contact @subat0mic on discord.

This mod was not directly given permission from dulkir, however he has publically said he will not limit open 
source developers from making forks, which this is. If dulkir sees this and is unhappy, i am happy to take this down.
